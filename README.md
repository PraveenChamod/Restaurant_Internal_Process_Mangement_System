# Resto - Restaurant Internal Process Management System
## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 Background

Restaurants manually handle operations, but this project automates food ordering, table reservations, and more. Mobile and web apps benefit customers, restaurant staff, delivery staff, and suppliers. Customers register, order, pay, and reserve tables online. Staff manage orders and communicate with deliverers. A tracking system lets customers monitor food delivery. Chatbot and search features enhance user experience. The web app aids administrators and managers in user and database management, stock control, supplier communication, and reporting. Suppliers receive instructions via the app. Interested users can register, receive alerts, view menu, prices, and ratings.

### 1.2 Problem Definition

The current restaurant management process is inefficient and error-prone. Staff handle multiple orders manually, leading to mistakes and delays. Owners manually manage staff and stock, contacting suppliers for supplies. This is time-consuming and limits expansion. Managing table reservations, meal orders, stock checks, and supplier communication becomes overwhelming. Customers can't review the full menu and prices when ordering over the phone, causing inconvenience for both the restaurant and the customer.

### 1.3 Solution

The project aims to create a comprehensive restaurant management system for automating tasks and enhancing the customer experience. The objectives include developing a user-friendly web and mobile app for ordering food, reserving tables, checking menus/prices, and making online payments. The system will handle online orders, communicate with deliverers, email new customers, and generate financial reports. APIs, payment gateways, and third-party services will be integrated for effective operation. A robust database will store customer information, orders, stocks, and other relevant data. The project seeks to create a scalable, adjustable system that meets restaurant and customer requirements while ensuring reliability and security.
